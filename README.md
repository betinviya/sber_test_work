###Part 1. 
Design a hamburger menu using as few html tags as possible. Position the menu in the center of the page. The menu container is 40px by 40px. When centering on a page, use absolute positioning. Do not use svg and images. When you hover over the menu, only the top bar is visible.

###Part 2.
